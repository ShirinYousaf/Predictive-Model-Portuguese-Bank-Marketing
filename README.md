## Predictive-Model-Portuguese-Bank-Marketing

Financial institutions increasingly rely on intelligent targeting to improve the efficiency of direct marketing campaigns. Traditional approaches often segment customers based on limited demographic rules or past responses, lacking the depth needed for optimized decision-making. This project introduces a supervised machine learning solution to predict whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit based on personal, social, and economic attributes. We analyze patterns across features such as job type, education, contact method, loan history, and campaign interaction. This approach enables the bank to refine its outreach strategy, prioritize high-probability leads, and reduce operational costs associated with ineffective calls, offering a scalable path to improved marketing performance.
